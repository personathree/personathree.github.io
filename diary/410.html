<br> today was kind of.. a day! i spent a lot of this day setting up this blog, ironically- but it was mainly a motivator to get myself to do more things during the day to have more to put on my page so i don't look like a complete and total loser. 
<br>
<br> this is mostly to appease myself more than anyone. i'm honestly quite content with how things are, even if they suck a lot sometimes. i think that's just a normal aspect of life.
<br>
<br>
<b>about my sleep,</b> i woke up early- albeit, kept falling asleep a lot, but that's okay. i managed to wake up pretty early, surprisingly! i started melatonin recently so that's probably helped out a lot even if my chronic exhaustion still persists.

i made myself a cup of hot chocolate to treat myself for waking up early! i've been getting more into cooking a lot lately, even if my food isn't... the best looking.

tomorrow, marvel rivals drops season 2! so that'll be fun to play around with! 
<br> i'm particually excited for this weekend as a whole. my girlfriend and i have a lot of plans, and i finally get to start a game i've been wanting to play for years. even if my backlog is years long, and i should probably get around to starting things i started but haven't even finished yet...

<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/ryd04w.png" style="float:left; padding-right: 5px;" width=120>i also watched <b>nimona</b> tonight, i'll spare a lot of the full details because i truly do believe this movie is something that should be experienced mostly blind if you don't know anything about it like i did. i started it in december with my girlfriend when we met up- but we ended up falling asleep and never got back to finishing it until now. actually such a beautiful movie that i was left in awe after watching it, i wish i could've written a better review for it because it was a movie i needed a lot due to it's themes at the time that honestly has helped me look at myself kinder.
