<br> or: better known as <i>the marvel rivals entry</i> and my thoughts on season 2

<br>
<br> had a pretty bad sleep today, woke up at around 8am and fell back asleep until 11am... but that's okay, because today, rivals season 2 dropped! i played a warmup game as jeff and honestly had a funny experience with a lord spiderman trying to target me and missing 2 solo ults. 

<br> big fan of spiderman players, i have to admire their dedication to playing him and going for the ragebait tactics LOL i tried playing him but could never fully understand him... 

<br>
<br> <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/yzba7e.png" style="float:right"> ended up playing a <b>lot</b> of rivals tonight (like... a lot!) but it was a worthwhile session! i don't think emma frost clicked for me as much, but that's partially due to me mainly only playing dps and healer anyways.
<br>
<br> my girlfriend also took a big liking to her, so i was more than happy sticking to my usual roles to let her get a better shot at picking the new character, especially with everyone instalocking her :P 
<br>
<br> <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/537csb.png" style="float:left; padding-right: 5px;"  width=230>the new map is very fun and we did laugh a lot at the unintentional vylet pony reference in the map (carousel and <s>constellation</s> cradle... exactly!) ran into a bunch of fun teams and good rounds on the mode that solely runs that map ! plus a highlight round i had from that night

<br>
<br> all in all, it's a very solid season so far, the events look promising, the battlepass is good and has a nice theme, and it's fun relearning how to play against a few characters due to their changes alongside a new one. i do hope the starlord bug is fixed soon though- he was still playable for sure !!
<br>
<br> also watched the marías coachella set and was inspired to fully listen to their discography!! it's very beautiful, and i do want to fully sit down and focus on it as i was listening while playing, but what i listened to was gorgeous!! ^^
